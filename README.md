## What is PostgreSQL?
- Objectâ€“Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS)

## What Makes PostgreSQL Stand Out?'
- First DBMS that implements multi-version concurrency control feature
- Data can be safely read and updated at the same time
- Able to add custom functions
- Designed to be extensible
- Defining custom data types, plugins, etc.
- Very active community

## What is SQL?
- Programming language
- Designed for managing data in a relational database
- Access many records with one single command
- Eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record

## SQL Queries
- We communicate with the database engine using SQL
- Queries provide greater control and flexibility
- To create a database using SQL:
**CREATE DATABASE** database_name;
- SQL keywords are conventionally capitalized

## SQL vs NoSQL Databases
**SQL Database:**
- Relational database management system
- Predefined Schema
- Suited for complex queries
- Vertically scalable

**NoSQL database:**
- Non-relational database system
- Dynamic Schema
- Suited for hierarchical data storage
- Horizontally scalable

## Data Types in SQL
- Integer types --> SMALLINT, INTEGER/INT, BIGINT
- Arbitrary Precision Numbers --> DECIMAL, NUMERIC
- Floating-Point Types --> REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION
- Serial Types --> SMALLSERIAL, SERIAL, BIGSERIAL

## String Data Types
- **CHARACTER/CHAR[(M)]**
- Fixed-length e.g., CHAR(30)
- CHAR without the length specifier (m) is the same as CHAR(1)

- **CHARACTER VARYING/VARCHAR[(N)]**
- Variable-length with limit e.g., VARCHAR(30)
- VARCHAR without (n) can store a string with unlimited length

- **TEXT** --> Stores strings of any lengt

## Date Types
- **DATE** - for values with a date part but no time part --> 2016-06-23
- **TIME** - for values with time but no date part --> 14:01:10
- **TIMESTAMP** - both date and time parts --> 2020-10-05 14:01:10
- **TIMESTAMPTZ** - both date and time parts with time zone --> 2020-10-05 14:01:10+02:00

## Create Table
- **CREATE TABLE:** This is the SQL statement that tells PostgreSQL you want to create a new table.
- **table_name:** This is the name you want to give to your table. It should be unique within the schema.
- **column1, column2, ...:** These are the names of the columns in your table. You can have as many columns as needed, each separated by a comma.
- **datatype:** For each column, you specify a data type to define what kind of data the column will store (e.g., integer, text, date, etc.). Here are some common data types:
- **integer:** Whole numbers.
- **text:** Variable-length character strings.
- **date:** Date values.
- **boolean:** True or false values.
- **decimal(precision, scale):** Decimal numbers with a specified number of digits.
<br>

**constraint:** Constraints are optional rules that you can apply to columns to enforce data integrity. Some common constraints include:
- **PRIMARY KEY:** Ensures the values in the column are unique identifiers for each row.
- **NOT NULL:** Requires that a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value.
- **UNIQUE:** Ensures that all values in the column are unique.
- **CHECK:** Allows you to define custom rules for column values.
- **FOREIGN KEY:** Establishes a relationship with another table's primary key.

## Some common SQL string functions and operators
- **SELECT**
- The most basic SQL function, used to retrieve data from a database table.
- Example: **SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;**
<br>

- **WHERE**
- Used to filter rows based on a specified condition.
- Example: **SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;**
<br>

- **COUNT()**
- Counts the number of rows that meet a specified condition.
- Example: **SELECT COUNT(column1) FROM table_name WHERE condition;**
<br>

- **SUM()**
- Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.
- Example: **SELECT SUM(column1) FROM table_name WHERE condition;**
<br>

- **AVG()**
- Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
- Example: **SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table_name WHERE condition;**
<br>

- **MAX()**
- Returns the maximum value in a column.
- Example: **SELECT MAX(column1) FROM table_name WHERE condition;**
<br>

- **MIN()**
- Returns the minimum value in a column.
- Example: **SELECT MIN(column1) FROM table_name WHERE condition;**
<br>

- **GROUP BY**
- Groups rows based on the values in one or more columns and applies aggregate functions to each group.
- Example: **SELECT column1, SUM(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;**
<br>

- **HAVING**
- Used with **GROUP BY** to filter groups based on aggregate values.
- Example: **SELECT column1, SUM(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING SUM(column2) > 100;**
<br>

- **ORDER BY**
- Sorts the result set by one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
- Example: **SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;**
<br>


- **CONCAT()**
- The CONCAT() function is used to concatenate two or more strings together. It works similarly to the || operator.
- Example: **SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;**
<br>

- **LENGTH() or LEN()**
- **LENGTH()** in PostgreSQL and **LEN()** in some other databases are used to find the length (number of characters) of a string.
- Example: **SELECT LENGTH('Hello, World!') AS length;**
<br>

- **UPPER() or UCASE()**
- **UPPER()** in PostgreSQL and **UCASE()** in some other databases are used to convert a string to uppercase.
- Example: **SELECT UPPER('hello') AS uppercase_string;**
<br>

- **LOWER() or LCASE()**
- **LOWER()** in PostgreSQL and **LCASE()** in some other databases are used to convert a string to lowercase.
- Example: **SELECT LOWER('WORLD') AS lowercase_string;**
<br>

- **LEFT()**
- The **LEFT()** function is used to extract a specified number of characters from the beginning (left) of a string.
- Example: **SELECT LEFT('Hello, World!', 5) AS left_string;**
<br>

- **RIGHT()**
- The **RIGHT()** function is used to extract a specified number of characters from the end (right) of a string.
- Example: **SELECT RIGHT('Hello, World!', 6) AS right_string;**
<br>

- **SUBSTRING() or SUBSTR()**
- **SUBSTRING()** in PostgreSQL and **SUBSTR()** in some other databases are used to extract a substring from a string.
- Example: **SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello, World!', 7, 5) AS substring;** (Extracts 'World')
<br>

- **TRIM()**
- The **TRIM()** function is used to remove leading and trailing spaces (or other specified characters) from a string.
- Example: **SELECT TRIM(' Hello, World! ') AS trimmed_string;**
<br>

- **REPLACE()**
- The **REPLACE()** function is used to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring.
- Example: **SELECT REPLACE('Hello, World!', 'Hello', 'Hi') AS replaced_string;**
<br>

- **EXTRACT()**
- **EXTRACT** function is used to extract parts (fields) of a date or timestamp value, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.
- It is particularly useful when you want to retrieve specific components of a date or timestamp for further analysis or reporting.
- Example: **SELECT EXTRACT(field FROM source) AS result**
  - **Extracting the Year from a Date:**
      - SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2023-09-15'::DATE) AS year;
      - This query will extract the year (2023) from the given date and return it as "year."
  <br>

  - **Extracting the Month from a Timestamp:**
    - SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM '2023-09-15 14:30:00'::TIMESTAMP) AS month;
    - This query will extract the month (9) from the given timestamp and return it as "month."
  <br>

  - **Extracting the Day of the Week from a Date:**
    - SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM '2023-09-15'::DATE) AS day_of_week;
    - This query will extract the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.) from the given date and return it as "day_of_week."
  <br>

  - **Extracting the Timezone Offset from a Timestamp:**
      - SELECT EXTRACT(TIMEZONE_HOUR FROM '2023-09-15 14:30:00-05:00'::TIMESTAMPTZ) AS timezone_hour;
      - This query will extract the timezone offset in hours (-5) from the given timestamp with timezone information and return it as "timezone_hour."
<br>

- **POSITION() or CHARINDEX()**
- **POSITION()** in PostgreSQL and CHARINDEX() in some other databases are used to find the position of a substring within a string.
- Example: **SELECT POSITION('l' IN 'Hello, World!') AS position;**
<br>

- **AGE()**
- In PostgreSQL, the AGE function is used to calculate the difference in years, months, and days between two date or timestamp values. It is often used to determine the age of a person or the duration between two events.
- Example: **SELECT AGE(end_date, start_date) AS age_difference;**
  - **Calculating the Age of a Person:**
    - SELECT AGE('2023-09-20'::DATE, '1990-05-15'::DATE) AS age;
    - This query calculates the age of a person born on May 15, 1990, as of September 20, 2023.
  <br>

  - **Calculating the Time Since an Event:**
    - SELECT AGE(NOW(), '2022-01-01'::DATE) AS time_since_event;
    - This query calculates the time duration between the current date and January 1, 2022.
  <br>

  - **Calculating the Duration Between Two Timestamps:**
    - SELECT AGE('2023-09-20 15:30:00'::TIMESTAMP, '2023-09-15 12:00:00'::TIMESTAMP) AS duration;
    - This query calculates the duration between two timestamps.
<br>

- **DISTINCT**
- In PostgreSQL, the DISTINCT keyword is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement to retrieve unique values from one or more columns of a table. It eliminates duplicate values and returns only distinct (unique) values.
- Example: SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
  - **Selecting Distinct Values from a Single Column:**
    - SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;
    - This query retrieves unique city names from the "customers" table, eliminating duplicates.
  <br>

  - **Selecting Distinct Values from Multiple Columns:**
    - SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
    - This query retrieves unique combinations of first names and last names from the "employees" table, eliminating rows with the same first name and last name.
  <br>

  - **Selecting Distinct Values with Aggregation Functions:**
    - SELECT DISTINCT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;
    - This query retrieves distinct department IDs along with the count of employees in each department. It uses the **DISTINCT** keyword in combination with the **GROUP BY** clause to ensure each department ID appears only once.
  <br>

  - **Selecting Distinct Values with Order By:**
    - SELECT DISTINCT product_category FROM products ORDER BY product_category;
    - This query retrieves distinct product categories from the "products" table and orders them alphabetically using the **ORDER BY** clause.
  - The **DISTINCT** keyword is valuable when you want to identify unique values within one or more columns of a table. It's commonly used for data deduplication and aggregation tasks in SQL queries.
<br>

- **JOIN**
- In SQL, the JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The JOIN operation allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, and it is a fundamental concept in relational databases. There are several types of joins in SQL, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN).
- Overview of each type of join:
  - **INNER JOIN:**
    - An INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
    - It filters out rows that do not have a match in the other table.
    - The result contains only the common data shared between the two tables.
    - **SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;**
<br>

- **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
  - A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (the first table specified) and the matching rows from the right table (the second table specified).
  - If there is no match in the right table, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
  - **SELECT customers.name, orders.order_number FROM customers LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;**
<br>

- **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
  - A RIGHT JOIN is the opposite of a LEFT JOIN. It returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
  - If there is no match in the left table, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
  - **SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name FROM employees RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;**
<br>

- **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN):**
  - A FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables.
  - It includes rows from the left table that have no match in the right table and rows from the right table that have no match in the left table.
  - NULL values are returned for columns from the table with no match.
  - **SELECT customers.name, orders.order_number FROM customers FULL JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;**
- **JOIN** operations are powerful tools for combining data from multiple tables in complex ways, enabling you to extract meaningful information from a database that is distributed across multiple related tables. The choice of which type of join to use depends on your specific data retrieval requirements.
<br>

- **CASE**
- A **CASE** expression allows you to conditionally return different values or perform different actions based on a specified condition. It's often used to implement branching logic similar to a switch case statement in other programming languages.
- Example:
- SELECT
   - CASE
      - WHEN grade = 'A' THEN 'Excellent'
      - WHEN grade = 'B' THEN 'Good'
      - WHEN grade = 'C' THEN 'Average'
      - WHEN grade = 'D' THEN 'Below Average'
      - ELSE 'Fail'
   - END AS result
- FROM student_grades;

- In this example, the CASE expression evaluates the grade column and returns a corresponding result based on the grade value. If none of the conditions match, the ELSE clause provides a default result of "Fail."
- While SQL's CASE expression allows you to achieve similar conditional branching as a switch case statement in other programming languages, it's important to note that SQL is primarily designed for data retrieval and manipulation, so its use of control flow and branching logic is somewhat limited compared to traditional programming languages. Nonetheless, CASE expressions are a powerful tool for conditional data transformation and retrieval within SQL queries.
